 Task:
WEBSITE CLONE:

 Utilising your HTML and CSS skills, I would like you to select a website and recreate the landing page of your chosen website from scratch, with your own HTML and CSS.
 
 Think about how the website is constructed. Which HTML elements are being used? How are these elements structured/arranged? What CSS properties are being edited to achieve the end result?
 
 Make use of the developer tools in your web browser to review the HTML and CSS of the website, in order to aid you in your recreation. CSS Overview in Google Chrome can give you insight into details     such as which fonts and colours have been used.
 
 Only the visual design/layout of the website is required, you are not expected to add any additional pages or functionality that is not achievable with standard HTML and CSS.
 
 Ensure that you take some time to plan your approach before writing your code, as this will aid you in the process! Pick a website that will challenge you, however, is also achievable.
 
 Once completed the website clone will be a good project to show off on your portfolio!
